Clipper Change Log
=====================================================================
v6.2.1 (31 October 2014) Rev 482
* Bugfix in ClipperOffset.Execute where the Polytree.IsHole property 
  was returning incorrect values with negative offsets
* Very minor improvement to join rounding in ClipperOffset
* Fixed CPP OpenGL demo.

v6.2.0 (17 October 2014) Rev 477
* Numerous minor bugfixes, too many to list. 
  (See revisions 454-475 in Sourceforge Repository)
* The ZFillFunction (custom callback function) has had its parameters 
  changed. 
* Curves demo removed (temporarily).
* Deprecated functions have been removed. 

v6.1.5 (26 February 2014) Rev 460
* Improved the joining of output polygons sharing a common edge 
  when those common edges are horizontal.

  incorrect solutions when open paths were added before closed paths.
* Minor code tidy and performance improvement

v6.1.4 (6 February 2014)
* Fixed bugs in MinkowskiSum
* Fixed minor bug when using Clipper.ForceSimplify.

* Fixed buggy PointInPolygon function (C++ and C# only). 
  Note this bug only affected the newly exported function, the 
  internal PointInPolygon function used by Clipper was OK.
 
v6.1.3 (19 January 2014) Rev 452
* Fixed potential endless loop condition when adding open 
  paths to Clipper.
* Fixed missing implementation of SimplifyPolygon function 
  in C++ code.
* Fixed incorrect upper range constant for polygon coordinates 
  in Delphi code.
* Added PointInPolygon function. 
* Overloaded MinkowskiSum function to accommodate multi-contour 
  paths.  

v6.1.2 (15 December 2013) Rev 444
* Fixed broken C++ header file.
* Minor improvement to joining polygons.

v6.1.1 (13 December 2013) Rev 441
* Fixed a couple of bugs affecting open paths that could 
  raise unhandled exceptions.
  
v6.1.0 (12 December 2013)
* Deleted: Previously deprecated code has been removed. 
* Modified: The OffsetPaths function is now deprecated as it has 
  been replaced by the ClipperOffset class which is much more 
  flexible. 
* Bugfixes: Several minor bugs have been fixed including 
  occasionally an incorrect nesting within the PolyTree structure.

v6.0.0 (30 October 2013)
* Added: Open path (polyline) clipping. A new 'Curves' demo 
  application showcases this (see the 'Curves' directory). 
* Update: Major improvement in the merging of 
  shared/collinear edges in clip solutions (see Execute). 
* Added: The IntPoint structure now has an optional 'Z' member. 
  (See the precompiler directive use_xyz.) 
* Added: Users can now force Clipper to use 32bit integers 
  (via the precompiler directive use_int32) instead of using 
  64bit integers.
* Modified: To accommodate open paths, the Polygon and Polygons 
  structures have been renamed Path and Paths respectively. The 
  AddPolygon and AddPolygons methods of the ClipperBase class 
  have been renamed AddPath and AddPaths respectively. Several 
  other functions have been similarly renamed. 
* Modified: The PolyNode Class has a new IsOpen property. 
* Modified: The Clipper class has a new ZFillFunction property. 
* Added: MinkowskiSum and MinkowskiDiff functions added. 
* Added: Several other new functions have been added including 
  PolyTreeToPaths, OpenPathsFromPolyTree and ClosedPathsFromPolyTree. 
* Added: The Clipper constructor now accepts an optional InitOptions 
  parameter to simplify setting properties. 
* Bugfixes: Numerous minor bugs have been fixed. 
* Deprecated: Version 6 is a major upgrade from previous versions 
  and quite a number of changes have been made to exposed structures 
  and functions. To minimize inconvenience to existing library users, 
  some code has been retained and some added to maintain backward 
  compatibility. However, because this code will be removed in a 
  future update, it has been marked as deprecated and a precompiler 
  directive use_deprecated has been defined.

v5.1.6 (23 May 2013)
* BugFix: CleanPolygon function was buggy.
* Changed: The behaviour of the 'miter' JoinType has been 
  changed so that when squaring occurs, it's no longer 
  extended up to the miter limit but is squared off at 
  exactly 'delta' units. (This improves the look of mitering 
  with larger limits at acute angles.) 
* Added: New OffsetPolyLines function
* Update: Minor code refactoring and optimisations

v5.1.5 (5 May 2013)
* Added: ForceSimple property to Clipper class
* Update: Improved documentation  

v5.1.4 (24 March 2013)
* Update: CleanPolygon function enhanced.
* Update: Documentation improved.

* Update: Documentation significantly improved.  

v5.1.2 (26 February 2013)
* Bugfix: PolyNode class was missing a constructor. 
* Update: The MiterLimit parameter in the OffsetPolygons 
  function has been renamed Limit and can now also be used to 
  limit the number of vertices used to construct arcs when 
  JoinType is set to jtRound.

v5.1.0 (17 February 2013)
* Update: ExPolygons has been replaced with the PolyTree & 
  PolyNode classes to more fully represent the parent-child 
  relationships of the polygons returned by Clipper.

  Int128 class (which is used only when polygon coordinate 
  values are greater than ±0x3FFFFFFF (~1.07e9)). 
* Update: The Area algorithm has been updated and is faster. 
* Update: Documentation updates. The newish but undocumented 
  'CheckInputs' parameter of the OffsetPolygons function has been 
  renamed 'AutoFix' and documented too. The comments on rounding 
  have also been improved (ie clearer and expanded).

v4.10.0 - 25 December 2012
* Bugfix: Orientation bugs should now be resolved (finally!).
* Bugfix: Bug in Int128 class

v4.9.8 - 2 December 2012

  orientation.
* Bugfix: Obscure bug affecting OffsetPolygons when using 
  jtRound for the JoinType parameter and when polygons also

v4.8.6 - 11 August 2012
* Bugfix: Potential for memory overflow errors when using 
  ExPolygons structure.
* Bugfix: The polygon coordinate range has been reduced to 
  +/- 0x3FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (4.6e18).

* Change: C# JoinType enum moved from Clipper class to 
  ClipperLib namespace. 
* Change: The Area function now returns the absolute area 
  (irrespective of orientation).

* Change: 'clipper' namespace changed to 'ClipperLib' 
  namespace in both C++ and C# code to remove the ambiguity 
  between the Clipper class and the namespace. (This also 
  required numerous updates to the accompanying demos.)

v4.4.2 - 26 August 2011
* BugFix: minor bugfixes in Clipper. 
* Update: the OffsetPolygons function has been significantly 
  improved by offering 4 different join styles. 

v4.4.0 - 6 August 2011
* BugFix: A number of minor bugs have been fixed that mostly 
  affected the new ExPolygons structure. 

v4.3.0 - 17 June 2011
* New: ExPolygons structure that explicitly associates 'hole' 
  polygons with their 'outer' container polygons.
* New: Execute method overloaded so the solution parameter 
  can now be either Polygons or ExPolygons.

* BugFix: Several minor bugs fixed. 

v4.2.6 - 1 May 2011
* Bugfix: minor bug in SlopesEqual function.
* Update: Merging of output polygons sharing common edges 
  has been significantly inproved

v4.2.4 - 26 April 2011
  Input polygon coordinates can now contain the full range of 
  signed 64bit integers (ie +/-9,223,372,036,854,775,807). This 
  means that floating point values can be converted to and from 
  Clipper's 64bit integer coordinates structure (IntPoint) and  
  still retain a precision of up to 18 decimal places. However, 
  since the large-integer math that supports this expanded range 
  imposes a small cost on performance (~15%), a new property 
  UseFullCoordinateRange has been added to the Clipper class to 
  allow users the choice of whether or not to use this expanded 
  coordinate range. If this property is disabled, coordinate values 
  are restricted to +/-1,500,000,000.

v4.2 - 12 April 2011
  JoinCommonEdges() code significantly improved plus other minor 
  improvements.

v4.1.2 - 9 April 2011
* Update: Minor code tidy. 
* Bugfix: Possible endless loop in JoinCommonEdges() in clipper.pas.

v4.1.1 - 8 April 2011
* Update: All polygon coordinates are now stored as 64bit integers
  (though they're still restricted to range -1.5e9 to +1.5e9 pending 
  the inclusion of code supporting 64bit math).
* Change: AddPolygon and AddPolygons methods now return boolean 
  values. 
* Bugfix: Bug in JoinCommonEdges() caused potential endless loop. 
* Bugfix: Bug in IsClockwise(). (C++ code only)

v4.0 - 5 April 2011
* Clipper 4 is a major rewrite of earlier versions. The biggest 
  change is that floating point values are no longer used, 
  except for the storing of edge slope values. The main benefit 
  of this is the issue of numerical robustness has been 
  addressed. Due to other major code improvements Clipper v4 
  is approximately 40% faster than Clipper v3. 
* The AddPolyPolygon method has been renamed to AddPolygons. 
* The IgnoreOrientation property has been removed. 
* The clipper_misc library has been merged back into the 
  main clipper library.
  
v3.1.0 - 17 February 2011
* Bugfix: Obscure bug in TClipperBase.SetDx method that caused 
  problems with very small edges ( edges <1/1000th pixel in size).
  
v3.0.3 - 9 February 2011
* Bugfix: Significant bug, but only in C# code.
* Update: Minor refactoring.

v3.0 - 31 January 2011
* Update: Major rewrite of the portion of code that calculates 
  the output polygons' orientation.
* Update: Help file significantly improved.
* Change: Renamed ForceOrientation property to IgnoreOrientation. 
  If the orientation of output polygons is not important, or can 
  be managed separately, clipping routines can be sped up by about 
  60% by setting IgnoreOrientation to true. Defaults to false.
* Change: The OffsetPolygon and Area functions have been moved to 
  the new unit - clipper_misc. 

2.99 - 15 January 2011
* Bugfix: Obscure bug in AddPolygon method could cause an endless loop. 

2.8 - 20 November 2010
* Updated: Output polygons which previously shared a common 
  edge are now merged. 
* Changed: The orientation of outer polygons is now clockwise 
  when the display's Y axis is positive downwards (as is 
  typical for most Windows applications). Inner polygons 
  (holes) have the opposite orientation.
* Added: Support module for Cairo Graphics Library (with demo). 
* Updated: C# and C++ demos.

2.522 - 15 October 2010
* Added C# translation (thanks to Olivier Lejeune) and 
  a link to Ruby bindings (thanks to Mike Owens).

2.0 - 30 July 2010
* Clipper now clips using both the Even-Odd (alternate) and 
  Non-Zero (winding) polygon filling rules. (Previously Clipper 
  assumed the Even-Odd rule for polygon filling.)
  
1.4c - 16 June 2010
* Added C++ support for AGG graphics library 
  
1.2s - 2 June 2010
* Added C++ translation of clipper.pas

1.0 - 9 May 2010
