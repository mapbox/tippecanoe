.SH Intent
.PP
The goal of Tippecanoe is to enable making a scale\-independent view of your data,
so that at any level from the entire world to a single building, you can see
the density and texture of the data rather than a simplification from dropping
supposedly unimportant features or clustering or aggregating them.
.PP
If you give it all of OpenStreetMap and zoom out, it should give you back
something that looks like "All Streets \[la]http://benfry.com/allstreets/map5.html\[ra]"
rather than something that looks like an Interstate road atlas.
.PP
If you give it all the building footprints in Los Angeles and zoom out
far enough that most individual buildings are no longer discernable, you
should still be able to see the extent and variety of development in every neighborhood,
not just the largest downtown buildings.
.PP
If you give it a collection of years of tweet locations, you should be able to
see the shape and relative popularity of every point of interest and every
significant travel corridor.
.SH Installation
.PP
The easiest way to install tippecanoe on OSX is with Homebrew \[la]http://brew.sh/\[ra]:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ brew install tippecanoe
.fi
.RE
.SH Usage
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tippecanoe \-o file.mbtiles [options] [file.json file.geobuf ...]
.fi
.RE
.PP
If no files are specified, it reads GeoJSON from the standard input.
If multiple files are specified, each is placed in its own layer.
.PP
The GeoJSON features need not be wrapped in a FeatureCollection.
You can concatenate multiple GeoJSON features or files together,
and it will parse out the features and ignore whatever other objects
it encounters.
.SH Try this first
.PP
If you aren't sure what options to use, try this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tippecanoe \-o out.mbtiles \-zg \-\-drop\-densest\-as\-needed in.geojson
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fB\fC\-zg\fR option will make Tippecanoe choose a maximum zoom level that should be
high enough to reflect the precision of the original data. (If it turns out still
not to be as detailed as you want, use \fB\fC\-z\fR manually with a higher number.)
.PP
If the tiles come out too big, the \fB\fC\-\-drop\-densest\-as\-needed\fR option will make
Tippecanoe try dropping what should be the least visible features at each zoom level.
(If it drops too many features, use \fB\fC\-x\fR to leave out some feature attributes that
you didn't really need.)
.SH Examples
.PP
Create a tileset of TIGER roads for Alameda County, to zoom level 13, with a custom layer name and description:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tippecanoe \-o alameda.mbtiles \-l alameda \-n "Alameda County from TIGER" \-z13 tl_2014_06001_roads.json
.fi
.RE
.PP
Create a tileset of all TIGER roads, at only zoom level 12, but with higher detail than normal,
with a custom layer name and description, and leaving out the \fB\fCLINEARID\fR and \fB\fCRTTYP\fR attributes:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ cat tiger/tl_2014_*_roads.json | tippecanoe \-o tiger.mbtiles \-l roads \-n "All TIGER roads, one zoom" \-z12 \-Z12 \-d14 \-x LINEARID \-x RTTYP
.fi
.RE
.SH Options
.PP
There are a lot of options. A lot of the time you won't want to use any of them
other than \fB\fC\-o\fR \fIoutput\fP\fB\fC\&.mbtiles\fR to name the output file, and probably \fB\fC\-f\fR to
delete the file that already exists with that name.
.PP
If you aren't sure what the right maxzoom is for your data, \fB\fC\-zg\fR will guess one for you
based on the density of features.
.PP
Tippecanoe will normally drop a fraction of point features at zooms below the maxzoom,
to keep the low\-zoom tiles from getting too big. If you have a smaller data set where
all the points would fit without dropping any of them, use \fB\fC\-r1\fR to keep them all.
If you do want point dropping, but you still want the tiles to be denser than \fB\fC\-zg\fR
thinks they should be, use \fB\fC\-B\fR to set a basezoom lower than the maxzoom.
.PP
If some of your tiles are coming out too big in spite of the settings above, you will
often want to use \fB\fC\-\-drop\-densest\-as\-needed\fR to drop whatever fraction of the features
is necessary at each zoom level to make that zoom level's tiles work.
.PP
If your features have a lot of attributes, use \fB\fC\-y\fR to keep only the ones you really need.
.PP
If your input is formatted as newline\-delimited GeoJSON, use \fB\fC\-P\fR to make input parsing a lot faster.

Tippecanoe ordinarily uses as many parallel threads as the operating system claims that CPUs are available.

.SH GeoJSON extension

Tippecanoe defines a GeoJSON extension that you can use to specify the minimum and/or maximum zoom level
at which an individual feature will be included in the vector tileset being produced.

{

with a \fB\fCtippecanoe\fR object specifiying a \fB\fCmaxzoom\fR of 9 and a \fB\fCminzoom\fR of 4, the feature

object belongs to the Feature, not to its \fB\fCproperties\fR\&. If you specify a \fB\fCminzoom\fR for a feature,
it will be preserved down to that zoom level even if dot\-dropping with \fB\fC\-r\fR would otherwise have
dropped it.

.RE
.SH Geometric simplifications
.PP
At every zoom level, line and polygon features are subjected to Douglas\-Peucker
simplification to the resolution of the tile.
.PP
For point features, it drops 1/2.5 of the dots for each zoom level above the
point base zoom (which is normally the same as the \fB\fC\-z\fR max zoom, but can be
a different zoom specified with \fB\fC\-B\fR if you have precise but sparse data).
I don't know why 2.5 is the appropriate number, but the densities of many different
data sets fall off at about this same rate. You can use \-r to specify a different rate.
.PP
You can use the gamma option to thin out especially dense clusters of points.
For any area where dots are closer than one pixel together (at whatever zoom level),
a gamma of 3, for example, will reduce these clusters to the cube root of their original density.
.PP
For line features, it drops any features that are too small to draw at all.
This still leaves the lower zooms too dark (and too dense for the 500K tile limit,
in some places), so I need to figure out an equitable way to throw features away.
.PP
Unless you specify \fB\fC\-\-no\-tiny\-polygon\-reduction\fR,
any polygons that are smaller than a minimum area (currently 4 square subpixels) will
have their probability diffused, so that some of them will be drawn as a square of
this minimum size and others will not be drawn at all, preserving the total area that
all of them should have had together.
.PP
Features in the same tile that share the same type and attributes are coalesced
together into a single geometry if you use \fB\fC\-\-coalesce\fR\&. You are strongly encouraged to use \-x to exclude
any unnecessary properties to reduce wasted file size.
.PP
If a tile is larger than 500K, it will try encoding that tile at progressively
lower resolutions before failing if it still doesn't fit.

Tile\-join is a tool for copying and merging vector mbtiles files and for
joining new attributes from a CSV file to existing features in them.
.PP
It reads the tiles from an
existing .mbtiles file or a directory of tiles, matches them against the
records of the CSV (if one is specified), and writes out a new tileset.
.PP
If you specify multiple source mbtiles files or source directories of tiles,
all the sources are read and their combined contents are written to the new
mbtiles output. If they define the same layers or the same tiles, the layers
or tiles are merged.

Because tile\-join just copies the geometries to the new .mbtiles without processing them
(except to rescale the extents if necessary),
it doesn't have any of tippecanoe's recourses if the new tiles are bigger than the 500K tile limit.
