WATSON, M.D., _late\u000aof the Army Medical Department._) [2]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\u000a\u000a\u000aIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\u000aUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\u000aprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\u000aI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\u000aSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\u000aI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\u000aBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\u000awas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\u000aother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\u000ain reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\u000aentered upon my new duties.\u000a\u000aThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\u000anothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\u000aattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\u000aMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\u000ashattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\u000afallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\u000adevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\u000apack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\u000a\u000aWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\u000aundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\u000athe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\u000aso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\u000aupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\u000aof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\u000awhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\u000aemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\u000ain sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\u000atroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\u000amy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\u000agovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\u000a\u000aI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\u000aair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\u000apermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\u000aLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\u000athe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\u000aa private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\u000aexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\u000athan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\u000aI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\u000asomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\u000amy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\u000aup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\u000apretentious and less expensive domicile.\u000a\u000aOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\u000athe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\u000around I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\u000aBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\u000aa pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\u000abeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\u000aand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\u000aexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\u000awe started off together in a hansom.\u000a\u000a“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\u000aundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\u000a“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\u000a\u000aI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\u000aby the time that we reached our destination.\u000a\u000a“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\u000amisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\u000a\u000a“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\u000aas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\u000aprice.”\u000a\u000a“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\u000ato-day that has used that expression to me.”\u000a\u000a“And who was the first?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\u000aHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\u000ato go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\u000awere too much for his purse.”\u000a\u000a“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\u000athe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\u000ato being alone.”\u000a\u000aYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\u000adon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\u000afor him as a constant companion.”\u000a\u000a“Why, what is there against him?”\u000a\u000a“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\u000ain his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\u000aknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\u000a\u000a“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\u000a\u000a“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\u000aup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\u000ahe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\u000avery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\u000aknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\u000a\u000a“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\u000acommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\u000a\u000a“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\u000ashould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\u000aenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\u000aAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\u000acould I meet this friend of yours?”\u000a\u000a“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\u000aavoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\u000anight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\u000a\u000a“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\u000achannels.\u000a\u000aAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\u000agave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\u000atake as a fellow-lodger.\u000a\u000a“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\u000anothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\u000athe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\u000aresponsible.”\u000a\u000a“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\u000aseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\u000ahave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\u000atemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 0.000000, 0.000000 ] } }

SHERLOCK HOLMES.\u000a\u000a\u000aIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\u000aUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\u000aprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\u000aI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\u000aSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\u000aI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\u000aBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\u000awas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\u000aother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\u000ain reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\u000aentered upon my new duties.\u000a\u000aThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\u000anothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\u000aattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\u000aMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\u000ashattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\u000afallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\u000adevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\u000apack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\u000a\u000aWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\u000aundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\u000athe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\u000aso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\u000aupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\u000aof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\u000awhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\u000aemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\u000ain sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\u000atroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\u000amy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\u000agovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\u000a\u000aI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\u000aair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\u000apermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\u000aLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\u000athe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\u000aa private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\u000aexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\u000athan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\u000aI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\u000asomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\u000amy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\u000aup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\u000apretentious and less expensive domicile.\u000a\u000aOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\u000athe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\u000around I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\u000aBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\u000aa pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\u000abeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\u000aand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\u000aexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\u000awe started off together in a hansom.\u000a\u000a“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\u000aundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\u000a“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\u000a\u000aI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\u000aby the time that we reached our destination.\u000a\u000a“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\u000amisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\u000a\u000a“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\u000aas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\u000aprice.”\u000a\u000a“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\u000ato-day that has used that expression to me.”\u000a\u000a“And who was the first?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\u000aHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\u000ato go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\u000awere too much for his purse.”\u000a\u000a“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\u000athe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\u000ato being alone.”\u000a\u000aYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\u000adon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\u000afor him as a constant companion.”\u000a\u000a“Why, what is there against him?”\u000a\u000a“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\u000ain his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\u000aknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\u000a\u000a“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\u000a\u000a“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\u000aup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\u000ahe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\u000avery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\u000aknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\u000a\u000a“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\u000acommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\u000a\u000a“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\u000ashould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\u000aenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\u000aAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\u000acould I meet this friend of yours?”\u000a\u000a“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\u000aavoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\u000anight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\u000a\u000a“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\u000achannels.\u000a\u000aAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\u000agave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\u000atake as a fellow-lodger.\u000a\u000a“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\u000anothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\u000athe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\u000aresponsible.”\u000a\u000a“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\u000aseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\u000ahave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\u000atemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 0.000000, 0.000000 ] } }

Here I rallied, and had already improved\u000aso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\u000aupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\u000aof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\u000awhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\u000aemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\u000ain sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\u000atroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\u000amy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\u000agovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\u000a\u000aI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\u000aair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\u000apermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\u000aLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\u000athe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\u000aa private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\u000aexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\u000athan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\u000aI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\u000asomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\u000amy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\u000aup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\u000apretentious and less expensive domicile.\u000a\u000aOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\u000athe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\u000around I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\u000aBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\u000aa pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\u000abeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\u000aand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\u000aexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\u000awe started off together in a hansom.\u000a\u000a“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\u000aundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\u000a“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\u000a\u000aI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\u000aby the time that we reached our destination.\u000a\u000a“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\u000amisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\u000a\u000a“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\u000aas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\u000aprice.”\u000a\u000a“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\u000ato-day that has used that expression to me.”\u000a\u000a“And who was the first?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\u000aHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\u000ato go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\u000awere too much for his purse.”\u000a\u000a“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\u000athe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\u000ato being alone.”\u000a\u000aYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\u000adon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\u000afor him as a constant companion.”\u000a\u000a“Why, what is there against him?”\u000a\u000a“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\u000ain his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\u000aknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\u000a\u000a“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\u000a\u000a“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\u000aup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\u000ahe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\u000avery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\u000aknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\u000a\u000a“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\u000acommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\u000a\u000a“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\u000ashould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\u000aenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\u000aAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\u000acould I meet this friend of yours?”\u000a\u000a“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\u000aavoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\u000anight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\u000a\u000a“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\u000achannels.\u000a\u000aAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\u000agave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\u000atake as a fellow-lodger.\u000a\u000a“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\u000anothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\u000athe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\u000aresponsible.”\u000a\u000a“If we don’t get on it will be easy to part company,” I answered. “It\u000aseems to me, Stamford,” I added, looking hard at my companion, “that you\u000ahave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow’s\u000atemper so formidable, or what is it? Don’t be mealy-mouthed about it.”" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 0.000000, 0.000000 ] } }

I should prefer having a partner\u000ato being alone.”\u000a\u000aYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\u000adon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\u000afor him as a constant companion.”\u000a\u000a“Why, what is there against him?”\u000a\u000a“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\u000ain his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\u000aknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\u000a\u000a“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\u000a\u000a“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\u000aup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\u000ahe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\u000avery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\u000aknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\u000a\u000a“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\u000acommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\u000a\u000a“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\u000ashould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits.

WATSON, M.D., _late\u000aof the Army Medical Department._) [2]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\u000a\u000a\u000aIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\u000aUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\u000aprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\u000aI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\u000aSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\u000aI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\u000aBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\u000awas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\u000aother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\u000ain reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\u000aentered upon my new duties.\u000a\u000aThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\u000anothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\u000aattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\u000aMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\u000ashattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\u000afallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\u000adevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\u000apack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\u000a\u000aWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\u000aundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\u000athe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\u000aso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\u000aupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\u000aof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\u000awhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\u000aemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\u000ain sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\u000atroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\u000amy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\u000agovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\u000a\u000aI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\u000aair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\u000apermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\u000aLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\u000athe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\u000aa private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\u000aexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\u000athan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\u000aI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\u000asomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\u000amy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\u000aup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\u000apretentious and less expensive domicile.\u000a\u000aOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\u000athe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\u000around I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\u000aBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\u000aa pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\u000abeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\u000aand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me.

WATSON, M.D., _late\u000aof the Army Medical Department._) [2]\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\u000a\u000a\u000aIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\u000aUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\u000aprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\u000aI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\u000aSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\u000aI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\u000aBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\u000awas already deep in the enemy’s country. I followed, however, with many\u000aother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\u000ain reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\u000aentered upon my new duties.\u000a\u000aThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\u000anothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\u000aattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\u000aMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\u000ashattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\u000afallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\u000adevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\u000apack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\u000a\u000aWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\u000aundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\u000athe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\u000aso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\u000aupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\u000aof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\u000awhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\u000aemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\u000ain sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\u000atroopship “Orontes,” and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\u000amy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\u000agovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\u000a\u000aI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\u000aair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\u000apermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\u000aLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\u000athe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\u000aa private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\u000aexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\u000athan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\u000aI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\u000asomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\u000amy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\u000aup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\u000apretentious and less expensive domicile.\u000a\u000aOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\u000athe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\u000around I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\u000aBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\u000aa pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\u000abeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\u000aand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\u000aexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\u000awe started off together in a hansom.\u000a\u000a“Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?” he asked in\u000aundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\u000a“You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.”\u000a\u000aI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\u000aby the time that we reached our destination.\u000a\u000a“Poor devil!” he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\u000amisfortunes. “What are you up to now?”\u000a\u000a“Looking for lodgings.” [3] I answered. “Trying to solve the problem\u000aas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\u000aprice.”\u000a\u000a“That’s a strange thing,” remarked my companion; “you are the second man\u000ato-day that has used that expression to me.”\u000a\u000a“And who was the first?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\u000aHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\u000ato go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\u000awere too much for his purse.”\u000a\u000a“By Jove!” I cried, “if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\u000athe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\u000ato being alone.”\u000a\u000aYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “You\u000adon’t know Sherlock Holmes yet,” he said; “perhaps you would not care\u000afor him as a constant companion.”\u000a\u000a“Why, what is there against him?”\u000a\u000a“Oh, I didn’t say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\u000ain his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\u000aknow he is a decent fellow enough.”\u000a\u000a“A medical student, I suppose?” said I.\u000a\u000a“No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\u000aup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\u000ahe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\u000avery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\u000aknowledge which would astonish his professors.”\u000a\u000a“Did you never ask him what he was going in for?” I asked.\u000a\u000a“No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\u000acommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.”\u000a\u000a“I should like to meet him,” I said. “If I am to lodge with anyone, I\u000ashould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\u000aenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\u000aAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\u000acould I meet this friend of yours?”\u000a\u000a“He is sure to be at the laboratory,” returned my companion. “He either\u000aavoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\u000anight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.”\u000a\u000a“Certainly,” I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\u000achannels.\u000a\u000aAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\u000agave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\u000atake as a fellow-lodger.\u000a\u000a“You mustn’t blame me if you don’t get on with him,” he said; “I know\u000anothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\u000athe laboratory.
